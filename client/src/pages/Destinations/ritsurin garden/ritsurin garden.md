# Ritsurin Garden

Ritsurin Garden (栗林公園 - Ritsurin Kōen) is a landscape garden in Takamatsu
City, built by the local feudal lords during the early Edo Period. Considered 
one of the best gardens in Japan, it is often suggested that Ritsurin Koen 
deserves a spot on the list of the "three most beautiful gardens of Japan" 
alongside Kanazawa's Kenrokuen, Mito's Kairakuen, and Okayama's Korakuen.

The spacious park features many ponds, hills, historic trees and beautiful 
pavilions divided into a Japanese style garden in the south and western style 
garden in the north. The gardens are set in front of wooded Mt. Shiun which 
serves as a wonderful background and great example of borrowed scenery.

Inside the park are a number of facilities including a folk museum, shops and a 
few resthouses where you can take a break and enjoy some refreshments amidst 
the beauty of the garden. Of particular note is the Kikugetsu-tei teahouse in 
the southwest part of the gardens where, for a small fee, you can enter and 
enjoy some tea on its verandas overlooking the ponds.

The park is close to Ritsurin-kitaguchi JR station and Ritsurin Kotoden 
station. There are also many buses that stop in front of the park.
