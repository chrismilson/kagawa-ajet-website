# Kanonji - 観音寺

South-west of Marugame, Kanonji has a lot to offer, especially for those with
an affinity for nature. The city is surrounded by rice paddies, and a temple or
shrine is within throwing distance of almost any location. With a nearby beach,
a waterfall, and several merging rivers, you have the modern conveniences of a
town, but still feel like you are in the country.

## Sights to See

### Zenigata
![The Coin](the-coin)

Kanonji is perhaps most famous for its giant Zenigata, or sand coin, which is
roughly the size of a soccer field and is lit by an eerie green light after
dusk. There are several stories to how the Zenigata came to be. One of the most
popular is dated to 1633, in which the zenigata was made for the Daimyo of
Sanuki, Ikoma Takatoshi (the founder of Ritsurin Koen), in only one night by the
local community. Another story states that the Zenigata has more supernatural
roots, while others believe that the Zenigata is a more recent development in
order to draw in more tourists to the area. In order for the coin to maintain
its shape, the Kanonji community holds a big restoration party every spring.

## 88 temple pilgrimage 

Kanonji is home to the 66th, 67th, 68th, 69th and 70th of the 88 temples of the
Shikoku Henro. With an early start and late finish, it is possible to do all 5
temples in one day.

## Suggested Hanami Locations

- **Shuinde Yama**
    - Although technically past Nio to the North, Mt. Shuinde is worth the
    drive, cycle, or long walk out to the park. Once at the park, you won't be
    disappointed. Surrounded by both the the Seto Inland Sea and the sakura, you
    won't know where to look first. There is also a nice little cafe that serves
    zenzai, tea, coffee, cakes, and sometimes other snacks.

- **Fudonotaki**

- **Kotohiki Koen**

## Suggested Restaurants and Izakayas

- **Kanakuma Mochi**
    - Most famous for tasty udon, but also for the year-round availability of
    Kagawa-style Ozoni (a traditional dish during New Years). It is between
    Kotohiki Koen and Fudonotaki.

- **Umajima Udon**
    - Another udon favorite among locals.

- **Gigi**
    - A nice izakaya with a hip atmosphere and friendly staff. Just around the
    corner from the train station.

- **Uzura**
    - Actually in Toyohama, but a nice izakaya right along the sea. Not the
    cheapest or most convenient place to go, but a worthwhile trip.
