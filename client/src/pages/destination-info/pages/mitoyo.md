# Mitoyo - 三豊

Mitoyo City is located on the west side of Kagawa. It is a collection of seven 
townships: Mino, Nio, Saita, Takase, Takuma, Toyonaka and Yamamoto. Although 
Mitoyo is called a “City” it operates more like what many non-Japanese would 
consider to be a “county.” Each of the seven towns have their own specialties 
which are described below.

## Things on offer in "The Townships"

### Mino

- **Cosmos Flowers**
    - Fallow fields are planted with cosmos flowers to brighten up the 
    countryside. Sometimes farmers plough a maze through the meter high flowers 
    for young children to play in.

- **Fureai Park**
    - This country park features an outdoor stage where Noh dramas are 
    occasionally performed. It also has a museum connected to the ancient 
    roof-tile kilns in the same area.

### Nio

- **Dragon Festival**
    - In the summer, the town parades a giant straw dragon down the main 
    streets while spectators thrown buckets of water on it, the carriers, and 
    each other. The dragon is said to bring the rain for the coming growing 
    season.

- **Mikan**
    - A very popular kind of orange, similar to a mandarin, mikan are grown 
    extensively on the mountainsides around Nio.

    scenes from history, legend and popular culture.

    - Tamaki no Yu is a popular and luxurious onsen located in Saita.

### Takase

    - Takase is well-known for growing excellent green tea. In the nearby 
    hills, the kanji “茶” (tea) appears on the hillside, made entirely of tea 
    plants.

- **Tokoji**
    - A Zen temple. The nun who lives at this temple teaches tea ceremony and 
    flower arrangement and is a respected member of the community. She has a 
    great sense of humor and a gentle teaching style.

- **Taiko**
    - There is a taiko group that practices in Takase. If you wander east of 
    Takase Station in the evening, just follow the sound of the drums to the 
    practice. The members are friendly and passionate about taiko.

### Takuma

- **Urashimataro**
    - Takuma is the location of the famous Japanese fairy tale, Urashimataro. 
    You will see a lot of references to the story in town such as statues of 
    Urashimataro throughout town and streetlamps shaped to look like the palace 
    under the sea.

- **Archery**
    - Takuma has Kagawa’s largest public Kyudojo. Members practice seven days a 
    week in the mornings and evenings. The dojo frequently hosts prefectural, 
    regional and national competitions due to its large size and beauty. It is 
    also one of the few archery ranges in Kagawa to have a long-distance 
    shooting range.

### Toyonaka

- **Chosa Festival**
    - A festival unique to this area of Japan. Giant portable shrines called 
    Chosa are brought from all over to engage in “Chosa Battles” where 40+ men 
    lift the giant shrine on their shoulders and toss it into the air among 
    other amazing feats of strength and showmanship.

### Yamamoto

- **Temple**
    - Botandera literally means “Peony Temple” and is a beautiful spot to visit 
    in Yamamoto.

## Restaurants

- **Splash Café**
    - Located next to Hijidai Station in Toyonaka, the manager used to live in 
    Boston and the restaurant makes quality french fries. The rest of the menu 
    is excellent with a fusion of American and Japanese flavors. The deserts 
    are particularly good. Another reason to frequent Splash Café is the great 
    music. This is perhaps the only restaurant in Kagawa that feels like an 
    American style café outside of Starbucks.

- **Cha Cha**
    - Located in Yamamoto it is difficult to get to without a car. Cha Cha’s 
    menu is geared towards more Japanese tastes, but is nevertheless excellent. 
    They also offer shabushabu style dinners in the evenings.

- **Jiji**
    - A stylish izakaya located on the border between Toyonaka and Takase. 
    Their menu changes seasonally but they always offer great drinks and 
    desserts. It is about a 15 minute walk from Hijidai Station or Takase 
    Station.

- **Fune**
    - The proprietor of this restaurant went abroad to study the art of pizza. 
    Light fluffy crusts and high-quality ingredients accompany a great view and 
    patio dining in nice weather. The restaurant is located half-way up the 
    mountain near Takase Station and is difficult to get to without a car, but 
    would be worth the hike if you chose to walk it. 
    
    They are only open until 6:00pm.

- **Green India**
    - Authentic Indian food with giant portions. Green India has great set 
    menus for low prices and an amazing chocolate nan.

    - a small stylish café tucked behind the Nishioka Furniture Store between 
    Mitoyo and [Kanonji](/destinations/kanonji). The food is fusion and the 
    desserts change seasonally.

- **Fuyu Tsubaki**
    - Located next to Motoyama Station, this small Japanese-style curry shop is 
    run by a couple from Tokyo. There are only two kinds of curry on the menu, 
    but they are both worth eating over and over again. All-natural wooden 
    tables and great music also make this a favorite. 
    
    They are only open Thursday - Sunday.

- **Pasta House Aldente**
    - A popular Italian restaurant near Takase station that has been featured 
    numerous time on Japanese TV according to locals. Aldente has an extensive 
    menu with pastas, pizza, risotto, and the biggest salads you’ve ever seen. 
    
    This place can get crowded, so making a reservation is recommended.

- **Crepe de Girafe**
    - Just down the road from Takase Station and next to Aldente, this is a 
    tiny crepe shop themed to… well, giraffes. It is a tastily place to stop 
    and grab something sweet and is popular with the High School Students in 
    the area.

- **Café de Flots**
    - Located in Nio, this restaurant has a mostly Japanese menu and tasty 
    desserts. This café also has a prime view of the sunset over the Seto 
    Inland Sea.
