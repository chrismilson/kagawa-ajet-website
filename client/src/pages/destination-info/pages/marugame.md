## Attractions

### Marugame Castle

Marugame Castle is the city's most famous landmark which has beautiful stone
wall called "Ougi no Kobai" - (the shape of a folding fan). Marugame Castle 
still retains its appearance from early times. It has a wooden structure (only 
12 wooden castles remain in Japan due to natural disaster) and magnificent 
castle gates. From the top, you can enjoy a beautiful view of the Shiwaku 
Islands, the Seto Ohashi Bridge and the Sanuki Plain.

### Nakazu-Bansho Park

Nakazu-Bansho Park is the garden of one of the feudal lords of Marugame and was 
constructed around the ponds and springs of Marugame. The second lord of the 
Kyogoku family "Takatoyo" built the park and it remains today clocking in at 
49.6kmÂ². The park has a museum containing old paintings, pottery and dolls.

### Iinoyama - "Sanuki Fuji"

Mt. Iino, located between Marugame and [Sakaide](/destinations/sakaide), is a 
part of the Seto Inland Sea National Park and is well known among locals. 
Dotted around the mountain you will find Yakushi-Do (house of the healing 
Buddha), an old teahouse (no tea sorry), and stone images of Buddha are. 

At the top there is a gigantic stone known as "Ojomo no Ashiato" (footprint of 
"Ojomo" - the legendary giant that built the mountain). Some locals living in 
the nearby towns, Hanzan and Iino, climb the mountain every day - some even 
take their pets!
