# Kanonji

Just south of Marugame, Kanonji has a lot to offer, especially for those with
an affinity for nature. The city is surrounded by rice paddies, and a temple or
shrine is within throwing distance of almost any location. With a nearby beach,
a waterfall, and several merging rivers, you have the modern conveniences of a
town, but still feel like you are in the country.

## Sights to See

### Zenigata

Kanonji is perhaps most famous for its giant Zenigata, or sand coin, which is
roughly the size of a soccer field and is lit by an eerie green light after
dusk. There are several stories to how the Zenigata came to be. One of the most
popular is dated to 1633, in which the zenigata was made for the Daimyo of
Sanuki, Ikoma Takatoshi (the founder of Ritsurin Koen), in only one night by the
local community. Another story states that the Zenigata has more supernatural
roots, while others believe that the Zenigata is a more recent development in
order to draw in more tourists to the area. In order for the coin to maintain
its shape, the Kanonji community holds a big restoration party every spring.
