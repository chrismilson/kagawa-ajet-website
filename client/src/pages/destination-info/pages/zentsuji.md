## Restaurants

- **Jumbo Udon**
    - In a normal udon shop you will usually find three sizes of udon; small,
    medium and large. Jumbo udon doesn't let you down and has all three *plus* a
    Jumbo size that is four times larger than small.

    - If you eat two Jumbo servings of Kamaage Udon in one sitting, your meal is
    free, and your name goes up on the wall! Amazing feats have been performed
    at this shop. Come and see the evidence that someone ate 12 times the small
    size in 12 minutes!
